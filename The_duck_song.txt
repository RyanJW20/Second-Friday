A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And then he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any grapes?
The man said, no, we just sell lemonade
But it's cold, and it's fresh, and it's all home-made!
Can I get you a glass?
The duck said, I'll pass
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
'Till the very next day (bom, bom, bom, bom, bom babom)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And then he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any grapes?
The man said, no, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade, okay?
Why not give it a try?
The duck said, good bye
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
'Till the very next day (bom, bom, bom, bom, bom babom)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And then he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any grapes?
The man said, look, this is gettin' old
I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold
Why not give it a go?
The duck said, how about no
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle, waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
'Till the very next day (bom, bom, bom, bom, bom babom)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And then he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any grapes?
The man said, that's it, if you don't stay away, duck
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day stuck!
So don't get too close!
The duck said, adios!
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle, waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
'Till the very next day (bom, bom, bom, bom, bom babom)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And then he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any glue?
What, got any glue, no, why would I, ooh
Then one more question for you
Got any grapes?
And the man just stopped
Then he started to smile
He started to laugh
He laughed for a while
He said, come on, duck
Let's walk to the store
I'll buy you some grapes
So you don't have to ask anymore
So they walked to the store
And the man bought some grapes
He gave one to the duck
And the duck said, hmm, no thanks
But you know what sounds good?
It would make my day
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Has any lemonade?
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away (waddle waddle, wadddle)
Then he...
